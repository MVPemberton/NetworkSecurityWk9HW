1) The Dionaea over HTTP honeypot was deployed.
2) Most issues encountered were just problems trying to install everything and figure out how to use the Google Cloud platform since it was my first time.  I had to look up various outside tutorials to finish.  Additionally, some of the Codepath links seem to be outdated as I had to switch to a different mnh github path.  Everything was resolved, though.
3) Based on my Attacks page from my MNH Admin browser, I had about 164 attacks on my honeypot vm, coming in from all sorts of ports.  They seem to all be pcap protocol except one httpd one at the very beginning.  I'm not sure how to see malware samples...
4) How would I see malware samples?????
